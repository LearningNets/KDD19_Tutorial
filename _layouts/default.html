    <p align="justify"><font color="#03CFFC"><strong>Description</strong></font>: Arguably, every entity in this universe is networked in one way or another. With the prevalence of network data collected, such as social media and biological networks, learning from networks has become an essential task in many applications. It is well recognized that network data is intricate and large-scale, and analytic tasks on network data become more and more sophisticated. In this tutorial, we systematically review the area of learning from networks, including algorithms, theoretical analysis, and illustrative applications. Starting with a quick recollection of the exciting history of the area, we formulate the core technical problems.  Then, we introduce the fundamental approaches, that is, the feature selection based approaches and the network embedding based approaches.  Next, we extend our discussion to attributed networks, which are popular in practice. Last, we cover the latest hot topic, graph neural based approaches. For each group of approaches, we also survey the associated theoretical analysis and real-world application examples. Our tutorial also inspires a series of open problems and challenges that may lead to future breakthroughs.  The authors are productive and seasoned researchers active in this area who represent a nice combination of academia and industry.</p>
